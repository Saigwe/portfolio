# Project Overview

This is a beginner machine learning project using Python and Jupyter, with a focus on predicting a country's medal count in the Olympic games based on historical and current data. The steps of a typical machine learning project, including creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error, will be covered.


# Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here.  This outline will help you tackle any machine learning problem.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.
