# Football Prediction Python Code

This repository contains a Python code that predicts whether a football team will win or not using data scraping, cleaning, and machine learning.


# Requirements

To use this code, you will need:
1. Python 3.x
2. Beautiful Soup 4
3. Scikit-learn
4. Pandas


# Data Source

The data used in this script is scraped from a popular football stats website using Beautiful Soup. 

# Web Scraping

This project uses Beautiful Soup to scrape football data from the web. The data is obtained from a website that provides historical football data. The website is scraped using Python's requests library and then parsed using Beautiful Soup.

# Data Cleaning

The script performs a series of data cleaning steps to remove irrelevant columns and ensure the data is formatted correctly. The data cleaning process includes the following steps:

1. Removing columns that are not relevant to the prediction model
2. Renaming columns to have more meaningful names
3. Converting strings to integers where appropriate
4. Removing duplicate rows
5. Handling missing data

# Prediction Model

The prediction model used in this script is a Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained using historical football data and predicts whether a team will win or not based on several features, including:

1. Goals scored
2. Goals conceded
3. Shots on target
4. Shots off target
5. Possession

# Possible Next Steps

Some possible next steps to improve the code include:

1. Improving the accuracy of the prediction model by including more features and fine-tuning the model parameters
2. Implementing a user interface to allow users to input their own data for custom predictions
3. Adding visualization tools to help users interpret the prediction results
4. Incorporating more data sources to improve the accuracy of the model


# Conclusion

This Python script provides a simple yet effective way to predict whether a football team will win or not based on historical data. With some improvements, this script can become a valuable tool for predicting the outcomes of future football matches.
