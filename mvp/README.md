# NBA Most Valuable Player Prediction

This project aims to predict the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) using Python. We will use web scraping to collect the data, pandas to clean and prepare the data, and scikit-learn's random forest algorithm to make the prediction.

# Project Description
The National Basketball Association (NBA) awards the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award to the player who is deemed to have had the most significant impact on their team's success in a given season. In this project, we will use Python to scrape data from various NBA websites using Beautiful Soup and Selenium, clean and preprocess the data using Pandas, and use a random forest algorithm to predict the NBA MVP award winner.

# Requirements

* Python 3
* Beautiful Soup library
* Pandas library
* Selenium library
* Scikit-learn library

# Methods

1. Web Scraping: We will use Beautiful Soup and Selenium to scrape data from various NBA websites, including basketball-reference.com. We will extract player statistics, including points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, player efficiency rating, and other relevant information.

2. Data Cleaning: We will use Pandas to clean and preprocess the data. This process will include filling missing values, performing data cleaning, removing irrelevant columns, and splitting the data into test and train datasets.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: We will use Pandas to explore the dataset and identify any correlations amongst the columns. We will use visualization techniques such as scatter plots and heatmaps to visualize the relationships between different features.

4. Prediction: We will use a random forest algorithm to predict the NBA MVP award winner based on the features in the dataset. We will use the mean squared error to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions.

# Results

The results of our analysis will include a prediction for the NBA MVP award winner based on the features in the dataset. We will also provide insights into the relationships between different features and how they contribute to a player's chances of winning the award.

# Next Steps

1. Expand the dataset: We could expand our dataset by including data from more seasons and incorporating new features such as player salaries, team records, and advanced statistics.

2. Feature engineering: We could engineer new features that capture more complex relationships between the existing features in the dataset. This could include creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or feature scaling.

3. Model tuning: We could experiment with different hyperparameters of the random forest algorithm to improve the accuracy of our predictions.

4. Incorporate more data sources: We could incorporate data from social media or news articles to capture the public perception of a player's performance and impact on their team.

5. Deployment: We could deploy our model as a web application that allows users to input player statistics and receive a prediction for their chances of winning the MVP award.
